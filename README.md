In this project, our aim was to develop a predictive model for stress based on data obtained from a questionnaire containing 11 variables, including the output variable. Through thorough visualization, we identified that only 5 variables significantly influence the output. These variables are the number of extracurricular activities, average hours of sleep, commuting time to campus, expression of feelings, and the amount of physical activity (in minutes) per week.
To achieve our predictive modeling goals, we employed various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Following rigorous testing, the Support Vector Machine emerged as the most effective model, boasting an impressive accuracy rate of 94%.
The next crucial step involved deploying the SVM model for stress prediction using Streamlit, a user-friendly web application framework for Python. This deployment ensures that our predictive model is easily accessible and usable for end-users. The Streamlit interface provides an intuitive platform for users to input relevant data and receive stress predictions promptly.
The key features incorporated into the model encompass the pivotal variables identified earlier, allowing users to input their data and obtain personalized stress predictions. This user-friendly deployment aims to empower individuals with insights into potential stress factors, enabling them to make informed decisions to manage and mitigate stress effectively.
By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, thorough data analysis, and streamlined deployment via Streamlit, our stress prediction model stands as a valuable tool for understanding and addressing stress factors in a proactive and personalized manner.
